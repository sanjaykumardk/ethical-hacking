101. Social Engineering
***

1. It involves studying the target
2. Manipulating the target to become as a victim for us 
3. So we will be creating the JPEG or PNG or URL
4. StormBreaker -  a github repo by ultrasecurity
5. With this we are going to create the BackDoors

6. TERMINAL :
   $ sudo apt update
   $ sudo su
   $ cd /opt
   $ git clone https://github.com/sanjaykumardk/Storm-Breaker.git
   $ cd Storm-Breaker
   $ ls

   $ sudo bash install.sh
   # Sometimes you can get error like Externally Managed Environment
   $ python3 -m venv .venv
   # If it still showa error then,
   $ sudo apt install python3.11-venv
   # This enables us the PIP module for the virtual environment
   # To Activate This Environment : $ source .venv/bin/activate
   # Now Run this one more time : $ sudo bash install.sh
   # We might also get error but you can see that there some upgradations are being done
   # Now error really doesnt matter

   $ sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ sudo python3 st.py

   #  AND HERE YOU GO YOU CAN SEE THE DASHBOARD FOR STORM BREAKER

102. Ngrok Settings
***

1. If we want to run a web server in your Kali Linux Machine,by using Ngrok you can get public IP
and without knowing others to know your public IP
2. IF you create a Backdoor and send it to the Victim and you can get their Details

3. ACTUALLY NGROK IS NOT ILLEGAL AND IT PROVIDES BEST TUNNELING SERVICE

4. GO Google : ngrok.com

5. 
   To Extract : sudo tar -xvzf ~/Downloads/https://bin.equinox.io/c/bNyj1mQVY4c/ngrok-v3-stable-linux-amd64.tgz -C /usr/local/bin
   To Auth Token : ./ngrok config add-authtoken 2ftdOqSmvSuE7Gwa5EZdkNsPaHG_2MTHdMEwehdpUDLxDsYyB

104. Malware Types
***

1. Randsomware - BLACKMAILS YOU Like it encrypts your data by changing the extensions of files and if you give the correct
password it retreives you the data back

2. Spyware - Targets individual like gets datas for the credit card of the target and sends 
the datas to the Hacker. Example : It comes wth the application when you download the mod version of
that application

3. Adware - Kind of sneaky malware Spams you with ads ( advertisments ) 

4. Worms - Can actually spread themselves in the network over internet ( Like spreading corona Virus )
   whereas virus is same as worms but it doesnot spread itself 

5. Botnets - It just runs in the background like it will be hibernate for 5-6 months and after 
a period of time it starts running

6. Trojans - It looks like a malware but it is a backdoor like png, or pdf, jpeg
