1. It involves studying the target
2. Manipulating the target to become as a victim for us 
3. So we will be creating the JPEG or PNG or URL
4. StormBreaker -  a github repo by ultrasecurity
5. With this we are going to create the BackDoors

6. TERMINAL :
   $ sudo apt update
   $ sudo su
   $ cd /opt
   $ git clone https://github.com/sanjaykumardk/Storm-Breaker.git
   $ cd Storm-Breaker
   $ ls

   $ sudo bash install.sh
   # Sometimes you can get error like Externally Managed Environment
   $ python3 -m venv .venv
   # If it still showa error then,
   $ sudo apt install python3.11-venv
   # This enables us the PIP module for the virtual environment
   # To Activate This Environment : $ source .venv/bin/activate
   # Now Run this one more time : $ sudo bash install.sh
   # We might also get error but you can see that there some upgradations are being done
   # Now error really doesnt matter

   $ sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ sudo python3 st.py

   #  AND HERE YOU GO YOU CAN SEE THE DASHBOARD FOR STORM BREAKER
